    <p>I didn't write yesterday, because I didn't find the time to. Now that I have time,
       I am writing on my Dev Journals once again. I don't have much to say yet, but I
       started working on a website to host nxdk homebrew and news as a test for my Web Dev
       skills. Hopefully tomorrow I will have more things to talk about, like XMusic. Goodnight everyone!</p>
