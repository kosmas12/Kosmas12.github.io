    <p>It's been a while since I last wrote here. It feels like an eternity has passed already.
       For that reason, I will tell you all what I've been up to these days.
       So, I am making a music player, XMusic, that you may already know about.
       Recently I rewrote this music player to use SDL_mixer as its backend
       instead of SDL Audio. I spent a few days trying to make my nxdk use SDL_mixer, because I have
       no clue how Git works. OK, I did that, then I spent 2 days trying to make XMusic work
       with SDL_mixer, but for some reason it works on PC but Xbox has no sound (which just defeats
       the whole point of this program). I've been trying to make various corrections to it, but really
       I just can't get it to work on Xbox, at least on XQEMU (A low level emulator of it.) I tried making
       it work exactly like the SDL_mixer sample from nxdk, but no luck. I don't know how I can fix this,
       but I have to and I know that eventually I will fix it, because I have to. That "eventually" though
       is what I don't like. Goodnight everyone!</p>
