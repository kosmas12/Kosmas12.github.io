    <h1>May 27, 2020 22:30 UTC+3</h1>
  <p>So, here I am, at the same time as yesterday, writing my Dev Journal.
     I actually think I will like doing this, but time will tell. Today,
     I didn't do much, but I did improve my website a bit (Check repo).
     I need to improve XMusic, but right now I am overwhelmed by other
     things I need to do, so it isn't possible for now, maybe in the weekend.
     Until the next time, everybody!</p>
