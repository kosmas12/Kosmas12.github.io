    <h1>June 23, 2020, 5:02PM UTC+3</h1>
    <p>Some things happened the last 2 days, though not much. I helped a friend over at XboxDev
    make an EEpROM reader/saver to save the HDD and online keys of the Xbox, along with the serial number.
   That tool might be used to help the people making Insignia, since it needs
   some keys from the EEpROM. Then also I licensed the legal homebrew website I was thinking of making,
   and now it is under the GNU AGPL v3 license, and made its repo public, so now I finally have an official
   license instead of a README saying "You are free to use this" on one of my projects. I will license this
   website too, today. I finally feel like I am willing to work on the legal homebrew website, and that I've
   got someting offcial to work on. Until the next time, everyone!</p>
