    <h1>May 26, 2020, 22:30 UTC+3</h1>
    <p>Today I finally "completed" my personal website.
    I've been looking forward to making it, to actually
    use the Web Dev knowledge I have so far. The website
    itself still has a long way to go in terms of appearance
    and functionality, but for now I want it just for my Dev
    Journals and have something to show the world.
    Other than that, I finished my XMusic's file browser
    for Xbox and started rewriting its backend to use
    SDL_mixer instead of SDL_audio, because then streaming
    on limited amounts of RAM such as that of the Xbox is
    already taken care of, and I can play more formats
    other than .wav, and SDL_mixer will just take care of it.
    Goodnight everyone!</p>
